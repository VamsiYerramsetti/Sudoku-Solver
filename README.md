# AI Sudoku Solver

### Overview
Tim and I developed a strategy to solve Sudoku puzzles by approaching them as a constraint satisfaction problem. This project was awarded a perfect score (10/10) by the AI: Principles & Techniques (SOW-BKI259) course teaching team.

### Approach
We treated Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem, leveraging AI techniques to devise an effective solving strategy. Our method ensures that all puzzle constraints are satisfied.

### Features
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Ensures all Sudoku rules are adhered to.
- **Efficient Solving**: Implements an optimized algorithm for quick and accurate solutions.
